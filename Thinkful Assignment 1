Assignment: How you could use A/B test to find an answer.

1)-Previous supplement used vs New supplement used. 

-We would send out samples of the new supplement out to current subscribers and randomly interview subscribers on the new
supplement if it helps them sleep better or not.

-We expect the new supplement will result in helping people sleep better. Since we
are dealing with people here, we want to look at other information such as age and
gender groups of our subscribers for both previous and new supplement. We can also 
look at how fast the new supplement puts people to sleep vs the previous supplement.

-If our subscriber's age and gender groups are similar but the new supplement 
improves sleep more than the previous supplement, then we could conclude the new
supplement does help people sleep better.

2) Will a new uniform help the gym's business?

-A loose uniform vs a tight-fit uniform

-We could have the employees to wear loose-fit uniforms one month, and have them
wear the tight-fit uniforms on the next month and compare the business.

-We expect the employee's tight fit uniforms to attract more business because tight
fit clothing shows off the body better than the loose-fit. We want our customers
to look at our employee's fitness and become inspired.

-If the business improves in the 2nd month, then we can conclude the tight-fit 
uniforms have an affect on the customers decision to go to the gym.

3) If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

-"please read"(Black Italic Text) vs "Please Read"(In Red Bold Text)

-Randomly send one of versions to a group of people, wait awhile, and send
the other version (Red bold text), to another group of people and compare
the clickthrough rate.

-I expect the "Please Read"(In Red Bold Text) to gain a sense of urgency to read
the email based on the red bold text in the subject. 

-If the red bold text's click rate exceeds the black italic text in the subject, 
we can say the red bold texts catches reader's attention better than normal texts.
